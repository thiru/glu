# Global Lisp Utilities

Contains Common Lisp utilties that should be useful for most of my apps.

Although I'm using the GPLv2 license for this project, much of the code is taken from other sources ([On Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html), [Let Over Lambda](http://letoverlambda.com/index.cl)) which I obviously don't claim ownership of. These bits of code may contain different licenses.
